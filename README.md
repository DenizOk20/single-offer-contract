# Soroban Single Offer Smart Contract

This is a smart contract built using [Soroban](https://soroban.stellar.org/) that allows a seller to create a **single fixed-rate offer** to trade one token for another.

## ðŸ§© Features

- Create a trade offer between two tokens
- Enforce fixed-price trades (reject trades that don't meet expected price)
- Allow the seller to update prices or withdraw remaining tokens
- Includes full unit tests for functionality and authorization logic
